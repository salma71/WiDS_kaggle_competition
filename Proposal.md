*Description of the problem*

The ability to obtain a rapid understanding of the context of a patient’s overall health can be crucial to medical outcomes. Patients go to hospitals for a variety of reasons. These reasons range from benign to severe and the state of patients can also range from alert to unconscious. Gathering information that is important for treatment requires processing of patient data but the lack of verified medical histories and the structural inefficiencies of obtaining medical records that take days to transfer pose a problem for medical staff who would benefit from quickly knowing the presence of certain chronic conditions such as heart disease, injuries, or diabetes in a patient. Additionally, patients can also be uncooperative or untruthful and withhold information. For these reasons, the ability to detect chronic condition from basic data can be of great value to make informed clinical decisions. 

Diabetes Mellitus, or simply diabetes is one of these chronic condition that is important for medical practitioners to be aware of when treating patients. Detecting the presence of diabetes from patient data is a supervised machine learning problem of binary classification and a number of tools such as discriminant analysis, logistic regression and naive Bayes can be utilized for detection of diabetes. Analysis of the dataset (specify dataset) can help discover insights useful for model building, inference and prediction. 

*Why it’s interesting*

This is an interesting problem because it is not limited to diabetes. Any number of chronic health conditions can be detected using the same methodology. It is also useful because it may be used to detect conditions that patients may not even know they had. This is a step in the direction of provided better patient specific healthcare. 

*What other approaches have been tried*

Research approaches

Research how diabetes is normally diagnosed.

*Hypothesis*

The presence of Diabetes Milletus can be detected from patient data collected within the first 24 hrs in an Intensive Care Unit. A parsimonious binary classification model can be built using variable selection and regularization techniques. The classification threshold can be adjusted to maximize sensitivity (true positive rate) of detection. 

*How the solution will improve the problem*

The proposed solution solves the problem by providing medical staff with another tool for quick diagnosis without the need to potentially costly and slow tests.
