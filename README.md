# WiDS kaggle competition_2021

## Introduction

> The WiDS Datathon 2021 focuses on patient health, with an emphasis on the chronic condition of diabetes, through data from MIT’s GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score) initiative. Brought to you by the WiDS Worldwide team at Stanford, the West Big Data Innovation Hub, and the WiDS Datathon Committee, this year’s datathon is open until March 1, 2021. Winners will be announced at the WiDS Conference via live stream, reaching a community of 100,000+ data enthusiasts across more than 85 countries.

## Code Samples

> Overview
This year's challenge will focus on models to determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus. Using data from the first 24 hours of intensive care, individuals and teams will explore labeled training data for model development. Participants will then upload predictions for unlabeled data to Kaggle and these predictions will be used to determine the public leaderboard rankings, as well as the final leaderboard revealed at the close of the competition.
